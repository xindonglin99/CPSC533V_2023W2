    "This assignment is on vanilla policy gradients (VPG) methods and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).\n",
    "You will be implementing the loss functions for vanilla policy gradients (VPG), running some experiments on it, and then implementing clipped-PPO policy gradients and its loss function.  The change for PPO is simple and it yields efficient-to-compute stable policy updates, making PPO one of the most widely used DeepRL algorithms today.\n",

    "Goals:\n",
    "- To understand policy gradient RL and to implement the relevant training losses, for both discrete and continuous action spaces\n",

    "### Quick recap of policy gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we create a **differentiable policy** $\\pi$ to be optimized so as to yield actions that yield high return.  To optimize the policy, we generate samples in the environment and we use those to compute a \"modulated gradient\" usable for gradient ascent on the policy parameters.  The modulated gradient consists of two terms: (1) the bare policy gradient term $\\text{log}(\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t))$,  and the (2) reward/advantage modulator term $A_t$.  Note that $a_t$ is the action that was actually chosen and sent to the environment.  In PyTorch, we implement this modulated gradient by multiplying the two terms together in the following loss function and then calling backward on it:\n",
    "$$L^{PG}(\\theta) = \\text{log}(\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)) * A_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy gradient term by itself indicates the direction required to move the policy parameters to *make the action that we chose more probable*.  By itself, this does nothing useful, if applied equally to all samples.  However, by multiplying this gradient by the advantage $A_t$, the full modulated gradient tells us how to move in the direction that makes good actions more probably and bad actions less probable.  When $A_t$ is large in absolute value, we should change the probability a lot. When $A_t$ is negative, we should make that action less likely.  This lets us use a non-differentiable reward signal to modulate the policy's gradient.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a basic network defined for both the discrete and Gaussian actor. It has 1 hidden layer that contains 200 neurons.\n",
    "For the discrete actor, we mapped from the state to logits of the actions. Categorical distribution is used here for transforming the logits into probabilities. Actions are sampled from this.\n",
    "For the Gaussian actor, we mapped from the state to the means of the Gaussians for each action. A standard deviation of e^(-0.5) is initialized and learnt later. Actions are sample from a Normal distribution of the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "For the ActorCritic module, it contains an actor which is either discrete or Gaussian and also a value function that has the same network structure as the actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.b\n",
    "The \"Categorical\" uses the logits as log probabilities. So it will use a softmax to transform it to probabilities, i.e. take e^logits and normalize by divided the sum of all e^logits. See the above cells for result.\n",

    "#### 1.c\n",
    "The categorical itself is a discrete distribution so it doesn't have any gradient to compute. However, the softmax of the logits can have a gradient propogated back. Since probs = softmax(logits), we can compute gradient of the softmax wrt the logits. Specifically, in this case, we can have $$log(\\pi(a_t))=log(\\frac{e^{\\text{logits}[a_t]}}{\\sum_i e^{\\text{logits}[a_i]}})=\\text{logits}[a_t] - log(\\sum_i e^{\\text{logits}[a_i]})$$, so the gradient for the $a_t$ entry is $$1-\\frac{e^{\\text{logits}[a_t]}}{\\sum_i e^{\\text{logits}[a_i]}}=1-\\text{probs}[a_t]$$.\n",

    "#### 1.e\n",
    "The gradients provide a direction that the policy should shift to make the action more probable. For example, in the Gaussian case 1.d, the mean of the Gaussian distribution for axis 0 should shift right to let the mean get closer to 0.1 so that action is more probable. For the discrete case, the logits of the action that's sampled will increase to make that action more probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.f\n",
    "The paper states that using the advantage function yields almost the lowest possible variance. This is because the advantage function measures whether or not the action is better or worse than the policy’s default behavior, which gives a good direction for the update.\n",
