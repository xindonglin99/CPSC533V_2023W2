    "You will be implementing the loss functions for vanilla policy gradients (VPG), running some experiments on it, and then implementing clipped-PPO policy gradients and its loss function.  The change for PPO is simple and it yields efficient-to-compute stable policy updates, making PPO one of the most widely used DeepRL algorithms today.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea is that we create a **differentiable policy** $\\pi$ to be optimized so as to yield actions that yield high return.  To optimize the policy, we generate samples in the environment and we use those to compute a \"modulated gradient\" usable for gradient ascent on the policy parameters.  The modulated gradient consists of two terms: (1) the bare policy gradient term $\\text{log}(\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t))$,  and the (2) reward/advantage modulator term $A_t$.  Note that $a_t$ is the action that was actually chosen and sent to the environment.  In PyTorch, we implement this modulated gradient by multiplying the two terms together in the following loss function and then calling backward on it:\n",
    "$$L^{PG}(\\theta) = \\text{log}(\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)) * A_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The policy gradient term by itself indicates the direction required to move the policy parameters to *make the action that we chose more probable*.  By itself, this does nothing useful, if applied equally to all samples.  However, by multiplying this gradient by the advantage $A_t$, the full modulated gradient tells us how to move in the direction that makes good actions more probably and bad actions less probable.  When $A_t$ is large in absolute value, we should change the probability a lot. When $A_t$ is negative, we should make that action less likely.  This lets us use a non-differentiable reward signal to modulate the policy's gradient.\n",
